# Customer Behavior & Value Insights

## New vs Repeat Customers
• A majority of customers place only one order, indicating low repeat purchase behavior.
• This suggests the business relies heavily on customer acquisition rather than retention.

## Purchase Frequency & Retention
• Time between first and second purchases varies significantly across customers.
• Longer gaps between purchases indicate opportunities for re-engagement through marketing or loyalty programs.

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
• A small group of customers contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue.
• Identifying and retaining high-value customers can significantly improve overall business performance.
